all "frontends" uses the same lock, [1192]frontend.txt[1193] you can list locks with [111] -121---882047- This worked, thankyou! -121---882116- this only works on new versions of gnome and not the version I was using at the time. -121---882148- Welcome to AskUbuntu, you should answer the question with the clear description, would you mind to edit this in details, what you did, the way to do that. For example, command you used. That makes people understand better. -121---882186- Welcome to AskUbuntu! At first glance it would appear that this would allow any user in the sudo group to start or restart a service. I believe the accepted answer is far more accurate. Cheers! -121---882175- @ElderGeek This allows specifically the user [112] to restart the service. It does not reference the [113] group at all. -121---882176- visudo — edit the sudoers file. See man visudo. -121---882177- Welcome to AskUbuntu! You may have noticed that this question asks specifically about Lubuntu 15.10. If your answer relates to a more recent version, it would be useful to [1194]edit[1195] that information into your post. If not, and you are still using 15.10 I highly recommend that you [1196]upgrade[1197] to a newer version. Cheers! -121---882215- this solved it for me -121---881991- I assume that the installation of bcmwl-kernel-source was interrupted due to which it remained unconfigured since the command you've mentioned is supposed to configure the packages which were left unconfigured during the installation/upgrade. -121---882019- As of Dec 11, it does seem to fetch [114] properly. -121---882117- Why does it need to start after ssh.service? -121---882247- for more clarification about this issue ( in my experience) the issue is back after restart ,So I have fixed this by deleting [115] and using [116] instead basedإ on this response : [1198]askubuntu.com/questions/517677/how-do-i-get-a-colored-bash[1199] -121---882113- works for ubuntu 19.04 as well, thanks :) -121---882094- I love Shutter but for quick screenshots that don't need annotation, I still prefer to use the default Ubuntu Screenshot program because it instantly gives two options - Copy to Clipboard or Save as. Fast and easy. -121---882290- thanks for info, however things as default keyboard layout or default resolution are not in the file -121---882001- @Youda008 I updated answer with changing grub resolution which carries over to login screen. -121---882002- I also updated the answer for default keyboard layout. -121---882003- It's [117], not [118]. But unfortunatelly, that did not work. The grub itself will run at the changed resolution, but then the login screen will be back at its default. -121---882004- Thanks for pointing out the typo. I've fixed that. The answer for grub resolution was not my own and I was just quoting what it said. What resolution are you trying to get and what are you getting instead? -121---882005- thx guy! have to do this another time after a while. Don't know why this font package get "corrupted"... -121---882095- Can confirm that for another Dell configuration: After switching BIOS SATA Operation from the default "RAID on" to "AHCI", Ubuntu 19.10 found the NVMe SSD on my Latitude 7300 and I was able to proceed with partitioning. -121---882239- Links to answers off-site can rot away over time. Could you perhaps supply more details in your answer? -121---882262- This solution does not work after Restart. -121---882096- +1 :-) I use [119] in the following context: [11100]Wake me up when a slow command line process wants my attention?[11101] -121---882057- @sudodus +1 on your linked answer there. I would never have dreamed of using [1110] for such an application :) -121---882058- seamless answer. I suppose ppa: states what ppa to add, and since there is no full path like in a URL but is a local URL continuation with a / it means from the trusted repositories instead of some random URL therefore this looks mostly...mostly...safe? Right? I am new to securityand only know basic password auth models. -121---882106- Thanks @Kulfy for the explanation! -121---882020- What Ubuntu version are you using? This problem is fixed as of 19.10 in GNOME on Xorg too. -121---882114- a 19.10 updated from a 18.04 -121---882115- when you restart the problem comes back again :( -121---882097- At the time the question was asked the aircrack-ng did not support the device. On 11 Nov 2019 [11102]this commit[11103] was added providing support -121---882041- [1111] works as wel. -121---881933- Finaly... Best solution -121---882170- This should be the accepted answer. The repo in this answer really provides a much, much more stable driver. -121---882042- This should be the accepted answer. Although, if I were you, I would have gone for Debian Testing non-free, as it has more up-to-date packages. Also I would create a backup (say, using TimeShift) for easy restoration in case it damages my system, steals my bike, runs off with my girlfriend, or does something else that I don't like. -121---882070- As far as I can tell, Debian Stable gets regular chromium updates and contains the same chromium version as Debian Testing. I chose the former to reduce the chance of some dependency being pulled from the debian repo (due to a higher version number) in cases when it isn't necessary. -121---882071- Note that the shortcuts in the above are [1112] where [1113] is [1114] for a new workspace, [1115] for the first, [1116] for the last -121---881974- I had installed the proprietary codecs stuff during the initial install of lubuntu, so maybe that's why I didn't need to use this additional command. Otherwise, it was a pretty fresh install, so I'm not sure why it didn't work for you. -121---882037- Thx. Your steps. The issue. -121---882195- This is working wonderfully for me on 19.04. I had to install the Debian key using [1117] and I also needed Chromedriver from the Debian repo for which the command was [1118]. -121---882072- Note that Chrome sync will not work with the dev version unless you apply for developer API keys. [11104]chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys[11105] -121---882075- no effect on macbook pro -121---882248- Why do you use [1119] rather than [1120]? -121---882076- lol............. -121---882036- +1: Your final comment may be correct concerning current versions of Wndows 10, but [11106]mkusb[11107] works with Windows 7, Windows 8 and early Windows 10 iso files (when [1121] size does not exceed 4 GiB). It is strange that [1122] works for me and many other people but not for you. Maybe it works for you too, if you try with Windows 10 (but obviously not with Windows 7). -121---882137- @sudodus I actually tried several versions of Windows 10 and then gave up and tried Windows 7. I could get neither Windows 7 or 10 to work with woeusb. Maybe something unique about my setup (but I think mine is pretty standard, other than using Budgie desktop) -121---882138- @sudodus Interestingly, woeusb just updated on my machine (since my earlier problems) and now it creates the USB just fine (I tested both Win7 and Win10). So, perhaps I should revise my answer to "Update woeusb" :-) -121---882139- Yes @John, it is a good idea to revise your answer to "Update woeusb". Thanks again for sharing your experience :-) By the way, today, 2020-02-15, my version in Lubuntu 18.04.x LTS according to [1123] is 3.3.0-1~webupd8~bionic0 -121---882140- It is good to add the details of the answer from the link in your answer in case the link ever goes down. -121---882083- @IanMackinnon In 19.04, I think you could already install Chromium from the Ubuntu repositories without using snap. If my memory is correct, it was only by 19.10 that [1124] began to install the snap instead. I do not like that type of redirection. apt and apt-get should never install a snap! I love this answer, btw. -121---882073- How does this add anything that the other answers don't touch upon? -121---882219- The fpm version and no outdated config. -121---882220- In my case I got a [1125]. To fix this just create a meta-release2 file with all the edits (Step 3) from the meta-release file in your cache directory. -121---881956- Can't I disable it just for Bluetooth connections ? See I use it to connect to my wifi which has a too long password for me type and I don't want to it (into a file) -121---882089- updated the answer, thanks for the question SebMa! -121---882090- When you say [1126], you mean [1127] right ? -121---882091- Or any other device, like my wifi dev on interface wlan0 for example. In regards to bluetooth, you either allow NM to control the local bluetooth device (bluetooth controller device) and therefore the remote bluetooth devices when connecting to it, or no bluetooth devices. -121---882092- Do I need to restart some service to take this configuration change into account ? -121---882093- In my case this brings me back to the terminal, and the 2nd [1128] boots to the primary OS. -121---882164- Thank you it worked for me on Ubuntu 19.10. -121---882194- [1129] will work around it temporarily. -121---881993- This is not helpful since option 1 may be any Python version (incl. 3.7 which seems to cause the issues). -121---882084- I found the same and it worked -121---881961- duplicate of [11108]askubuntu.com/a/469040[11109] -121---882266- Not only is this an incredibly helpful post, it actually does what I did expect [1130] to do. -121---881957- Question is about creating .desktop launchers [11110]on the desktop[11111], also creating by hand (editing with a text-editor) is already covered in a [11112]different answer[11113]. -121---882015- on 18.04, I had to install [1131] instead of [1132] as the latter was not found. Otherwise perfect. Thanks! -121---881872- I got this error on the "make" command:Checking dependencies for driver download... /usr/bin/xzcat /bin/cpio Makefile:34: recipe for target 'AppleCameraInterface' failed make: *** [AppleCameraInterface] Error 1 -121---881873- I'm not sure and I'm not about to replicate the error but [11114]this[11115] has some ideas. Also [1133] might work instead of [1134]. As I said this is what worked for might and there may be variations between different Mac models. -121---881874- Hey, that's my blog! Glad it's helping people; I've gotten lots of reports the notes I wrote up are helpful. Enjoy all that sweet Stack Reputation :-) Clon, Ubuntu stopped supporting 32 bit i386 with 18.04. You really can't upgrade. -121---881958- be aware that 20.04 will be out soon and once that happens you may find it impossible to upgrade [11116]from[11117] 19.04. You may want to upgrade to 19.10 soon. -121---881962- Tip: In VSCode in the bottom right corner you can change the line terminator frin "CRLF" to "LF". -121---882214- Sorry for my stupid question, but what do you mean by "[1135]"? What directory is that, and how is the DEB control file called? Or could you please just give a command to run via terminal...? :-) Thanks @MichaelSandman -121---882048- You can download Visual Studio Code and use it's built-in terminal - I had this same problem and I fixed it using the Visual Studio Code terminal via running the various commands through that terminal to fix the Python stuff [11118]code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads[11119] -121---882085- @lonix For one it seems the "stable" PPA hasn't been updated in over half a year -121---882077- @Jayaguru-Shishya, not a stupid question at all. The DEB package stuff is really esoteric. I've added some more description about the control file to my answer. Basically it will be in the current directory where you ran the create command and will be called [1136]. The commands to create and use the file to build a fake package are given above. Good luck! -121---882049- On Linux Mint (child or w/e of Ubuntu), problem was in the Software Sources -> Additional Repositories. Software installed had added a repository for the wrong version of the OS. -121---881975- yes thank you. thank you again. -121---882065- As per [11120]packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=python-gnome2[11121], [1137] is not in Eoan's repositories, and would also need a manual download. You would also need to download [1138], [1139], and a bunch of gnome2 libs manually, as [1140] depends on these. -121---882053- The buttons are little difficult to move but this is the answer for modern Plasma. Thank you. -121---882272- I suggest to add the [1141] and correct the name of the package in the command to install it to [1142] -121---882050- Tx! @Chemary, I've added your suggestions...good callouts. -121---882051- I like this answer for it's cleverness. Unfortunately, it's not a permanent fix...you will have to repeat this every time there is an update to the FAH package. See my answer for a "set and forget" solutions. Very slick approach, though! -Michael -121---882052- Agree. I do not recommend mixing and matches packages from older repos unless you really know what you're doing. Not a solution for everyday users, IMO. -121---882054- this is NOT recommended for sticks >=32GB. Reason: Fast sticks rely on exFat - formatting. All USB 3.0 and 3.1 do need exFat to work fast. Try yourself .... -121---882270- If you're interested, I wrote a blog about this with a little more detail here: [11122]mikekasberg.com/blog/2020/04/08/…[11123] I see the benefit of consolidating answers here on AskUbuntu, so this is summarized succinctly in my answer above. -121---882134- Nice, just tested this and it is also working on my newly installed Arch Linux system with [1143] as well! I suspect this is actually to do with Gnome 3 or maybe the new Gnome 3.36 that just came out! Love it, thank you! -121---882271- Not working .... -121---882012- You could also use xvfb-run which wraps Xvfb and is useful if you want to run just one command. -121---882252- What a comprehensive answer, thanks! If almost all of the originally "used" space was due to the 5% reserved space, and the overall filesystem overhead itself is merely less than 0.8% initially, I'm fine with letting the default settings alone. The reserved space is a good "safety net" for the general user, and it's usable by root, so it should not be changed unless one [11124]really[11125] knows what they're doing. -121---882192- 18.04 does not use ifconfig, it uses netplan. Going from 16.04 to 18.04 will keep ifconfig and may work better for your device, but I do not see how it is related to installing from unsigned repositories. -121---882153- That is almost certainly what happened. The point is that after installing 18.04 bare, updates did not work: "repository is unsigned". To get updates to work properly I had to install 16.04 and then upgrade to 18.04. -121---882154- Yes, thanks. I could have saved a lot of time if there weren't so many people saying contradicting things about "reserved" space being free, only being reserved for root, and therefore NOT showing up, etc. I even read about someone who didn't see a change after using tune2fs to remove the resversed space. People saying that all of the wasted space was due to fs administration. I wanted to know the truth, and being the (famous, haha) author of ext3grep, I thought I'd just dive into ext4 and determine once and for all what this was about. -121---882193- Ah okay, it's not that clear in the story above. But now on 18.04 you can still install from unsigned repositories w/o any error message? T.b.h you kind of want to get the message as it may indicate something is wrong and you can exclude specific repositories from this check with the answers above. -121---882155- Thanks! It worked. -121---882196- I had the same problem and neither gio nor chown would change the group or owner. -121---882128- Thank you, that's why I left Ubuntu and now I'm using Elementary OS. -121---882275- @IhabShoully how is it? it was sort of buggy last time i played around with it ~3 years ago. ...for what it's worth, I've sort of taken a liking to MX Linux lately. -121---882276- [1144] won't change the owner or group - it just tells gnome to trust it. check the owner/group with [1145], if chown isn't working check any error messages, you can only run it as root (ie with [1146]) and some filesystems (eg file shares, SD cards, windows disks) won't support it -121---882129- I have Ubuntu Mate 18.04, and this is the only solution I've found. Thank you very much!! -121---882183- Does not work. If I execute [1147] then nothing happens. -121---882107- How to upgrade from Ubuntu 19.10 to 20.04 ? I tried [1148] but it says [1149] -121---882108- No need to upgrade As I mentioned here: [11126]github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/…[11127] You can use "deb [11128]ppa.launchpad.net/phpmyadmin/ppa/ubuntu[11129] eoan main" -121---882109- Ok thanks. I figured out that 20.04 is getting released tomorrow, thats prob why it was not able to find a new release. -121---882110- I added [1150] into [11130]/etc/apt/sources.list[11131] but now I get [11132]Misshaped entry 51 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list (URI parse)[11133] if I execute [1151] -121---882111- Edit: I had to add [1152], However it does still say that it was unable to found the packet. -121---882112- Yes, it was buggy then but now it's stable. -121---882277- Cool! i'll have to give it a second look... -121---882278- Yes, it all works fine after following the upgrade procedure. It's rather puzzling that the .iso for 18.04 and 16.04 did not, in themselves, have the signatures to the standard repositories. -121---882156- Hello and welcome on Ask Ubuntu :) May I suggest you to elaborate a bit and maybe add the exact commands you would enter to see progress / abort / relaunch a snap install? -121---881902- Do you mean for 20.04?? Or 19.10 or 18.04..... What version of Ubuntu were you using when this issue occured... same as in post (18.04)?? -121---881981- Starting somewhere in April 2020, one additionally needs to change the bionic or links from [1153] to [1154] inside the [1155] and the [1156] files. Otherwise you get a 404 upon [1157]. -121---881959- @RobertSederholm It's 20.04 -121---881982- Steve dickey i have edited the question for better explanation!!! -121---881932- On Ubuntu 20.04 running [1158] worked for me. Thanks! And I guess since it is the system extension, it is the easiest way to disable it without breaking something. -121---882067- +1 This solved my problem. -121---882060- This is quite large: [1159], I suggest to add [1160] which results in just 30MB download and 300MB -121---881911- and [1161] is not needed -121---881912- @VladimirS. Where did you find those format string values? I found [11134]this[11135] page searching for documentation on this. -121---882296- You most probably meant [120]-d[121]instead. But even [1164] doesn't hide the dock on my standard Ubuntu 18.04 installation. It just toggles the enabled/disabled status for the extension (as seen in GNOME Tweaks, just as in the screenshot in the question), but has no effect on the actual visibility of the dock itself. -121---882068- I'm hitting the same wall. -121---881865- @rubo77 Might be true. Are you sure? What is it for? It seems mount.vboxsf might be required for mounting a shared folder? But the dependencies are mostly on the other two anyway. -121---881913- Not sure anymore, if it's needed -121---881914- @Michael You can find it [11138]here[11139] (at least some of them) -121---882305- perfect! I had issues of flickering and cut off windows (on dragging) , also a strange diagonal cut in chrome browser while scrolling down. This just fix it all. Thanks. Ubuntu 20.04 on Lenovo YOGA 910. -121---881931- Also works on 19.10. -121---881983- How did you install the [11140]apt version[11141] of Chromium on 20.04? It's [11142]not [11172]actually[11173] possible to install it on 20.04 (even on 19.10)[11143]. As [11144]another answer[11145] pointed out, it just redirects you to install the snap version instead. Please correct your answer. -121---881984- Chrome is not the "only solution" though, you can use Firefox (apt version) or other Chromium based browsers that can be installed with apt. -121---881985- Nice answer, thanks -121---881923- It works normally if you're in an Xorg session. The problem was different, Ubuntu 17.10 came with Wayland as the default instead of Xorg. Screen sharing doesn't work on Wayland due to its security restrictions. -121---882200- I have Ubuntu 18. Web.skype solved sharing problem for me. -121---882201- Yeah, because Ubuntu 18.04 and later releases comes with Xorg as the default session instead on Wayland. Read this: [11146]omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/01/…[11147] -121---882202- this works perfectly. Only thing is repackaging command is referencing data.tar.gz but the deb file I downloaded required it to be data.tar.xz so [1165] works perfectly -121---882022- when I tried to download the script from the link with the below command: curl -L -O github.com/thiggy01/ubuntu-20.04-change-gdm-background/raw/master/ubuntu-20.04-change-gdm-background I'm getting permission denied error! -121---881986- Similar answers in super user: [11148]Manually add a resolution to Gnome with Wayland[11149]. Updating the kernel boot parameter does make the new screen resolution available, provided you have the correct device name. -121---882205- [11150]That Linux_x64 directory[11151] is a jungle of thousands of cryptically named folders. How do you even pick anything? Whats's the latest there? -121---882025- On Ubuntu 20 I get an error that the PPA doesn't have a [1166] file so automatic updates are disabled. -121---882078- This sounds great, but Snap may not have access to removable media and data outside the home partition. So I prefer [1167]. -121---882158- @N0rbert If you want to access removable media, just run [1168] or change the permissions of the app using "Settings". Ideally, Arduino should just use [11152]XDG Desktop Portal[11153] so it can access any file the user chooses, but this is not yet supported for Java Swift apps. -121---882159- Unfortunately it resets to the GUI-selected one as soon as you switch terminal (even if you switch back). -121---882236- Reinstall and restart Chrome worked on an out-of-the-box 20.04 install. Bizarre, but it works! -121---882098- Thanks for the post. The script already asks if you want to install libglib2.0-dev-bin. @SubinR try with [1169]. -121---881987- Yes I also noticed that setting Gnome "Tweaks/workspaces" to "workspaces span displays" solves the issue. See [11154]my answer on superuser.com[11155]. -121---882274- idk if this works but I am pretty sure you are missing the username /home/<username>/snap -121---882217- This should be the accepted answer because it has the most up to date drivers. -121---882043- I didn't miss it, I did put it in the text box provided to answer the question. Somehow when the answer was posted it ended up with two forward slashes where in between those I put the username. This is how I put it. /home/<your-username>/snap/vlc/<your-media-file>. -121---882218- The archive.ubuntu.com link is now dead, use this instead: [11156]old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/disco-updates/main/…[11157] Worked ok for me. -121---881963- Wow! I've been without a mic for over 2 months, and after several hours of googling, this was the only thing that fixed everything. Thank you! -121---882223- This works great. How would I make it so that the file name is prepended with the letters "SS" ? -121---882299- @user147176 You can change the filename template in step 3, e.g. add "SS" before the [1170] that produces the date/time string. -121---882298- Going from 19.10 to 20.04 left me with broken pulseaudio config, I had no [1171] folder though but for me, running [1172] and rebooting fixed it, thanks! -121---882224- Thanks, this helped. Instead of doing a [1173], I used [1174] instead. So [1175]. -121---882066- It's a bad security policy to run graphical applications as root unless specifically prompted to do so by the application. -121---882055- Linux Mint is not Ubuntu. It is of topic here. -121---882225- On which version of Ubuntu? -121---882257- Thanks N0rbert. Apt-get should be backward-compatible (but not apt ) as stated [11158]here[11159], so it should work. -121---881908- This is a nice and short summary of the above answers. -121---882171- This worked for me, thanks so much! -121---881924- good hint, but doesn't really fit the question. Also, looks like this is on by default now. -121---882255- this is the only solution that worked for me on 20.04. the installer didn't work though. i had to manually copy both files in /root/etc/fonts to my own /etc/fonts/. upon restarting chrome i finally had emojis. thanks! -121---882099- Oh, what happens when you run the installer? -121---882100- very weird. i just ran your installer again to send you the error and it worked fine 🤷🏽‍♀️ -121---882101- Link updated, so now it works with any emoji font. -121---882102- That's exactly what I did. The problem is that it disabled ALL the power notifications, not only the ones related to the mouse. So if, for example, my laptop's battery is about to die, I won't get any notification. That's bad. -121---882179- Nice, i ended up having to do that on Mint, except i only had to manually grab [1176] and [1177]. If i could mark this as a answer also i would ;w; -121---882160- Yeah that's true, I JUST WANTED to switch that mouse notification OFF anyhow. -121---882180- [1178] -121---882190- It might not work for every snap package I suppose -121---882191- Did not work for me, though this is an interesting answer. -121---881976- Definitely best answer: worked like a charm on a Lubuntu 18.10 --> 20.04. Thank you! -121---881964- I do not think your statement, "The chosen Terminal Emulator depends on your default applications settings and Desktop Environment." is true. I have Xterm as my default terminal, but using 'Terminal=true' doesn't open in Xterm. How would this be enforced, here? It seems like this should be expected behavior. -121---882209- @AdrianKeister, it is opened, but in another terminal? And what launcher (or DE) are you using? -121---882210- You don't need live CD :) just press Enter and you will have root, then do fdisk and fsck :) -121---881935- service works perfectly on Ubuntu Linux using systemd; thanks for the fantastic tutorial. This is great for a laptop server. Also @Drew this is "Ask Ubuntu" not "Ask Different" the instructions are for Linux not macOS. -121---882249- What do you mean with "Editing should be remove all releases after cosmic"? My file has a long list and cosmic is in the middle... Thanks a lot for a short reply :-) -121---881965- From [11160]here[11161] these lines were crucial: # Required deb [11162]old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu[11163] CODENAME main restricted universe multiverse deb [11164]old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu[11165] CODENAME-updates main restricted universe multiverse deb [11166]old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu[11167] CODENAME-security main restricted universe multiverse -121---881966- Sorry, I am not an expert, but I also needed sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and sudo do-release-upgrade from the same link as in the above comment. But thanks for your explanations - it works :-) -121---881967- Thanks for suggestion. How stable is it? Did you have any lose of data, duplicated items and so on? Does it have indicator/icon in the tray/notification area? Will this icon be shown when installed from FlatPak? How did you installed on 18.04 LTS without [1179] in the repositories? Currently my Google Drive has 3 339 items, totalling 2,6 GB. I have a backup, but I'm a bit worried. -121---881996- Honestly, I am a very modest Google Drive user, so I am far from the size and amount of files that you suggest. I have made some tests to help you decide if you wish to give it a try or not. Of course, if you go for it then I would definitely recommend to make a backup first :) -121---881997- My main problem is that it is not available for my 16.04 LTS systems and that Flatpak version [11168]does not show icon in the tray[11169]. So I'll stay with Wine-based method on my devices. Thanks for detailed test and review. -121---881998- Hi, GlasierXplor here. Just a few notes: after trying to install Office2016 multiple times: [1180] needs to be installed in my tests, or else the installer will crash before it starts. I have also tried on wine 4.15 (x86) and it is waaaaaay more stable than in my original answer (3.19). E.g. no more random crashes. -121---881866- I'm running Lubuntu 20.04 I found that having ~/cache/obexd open in my file manager helped to insure that files were received. -121---882240- How is it possible they didn't mark it anywhere? I've upgraded from 19.10 and looks like it didn't change that (or maybe it failed to apply this change?) -121---882253- @TimothyWong firstly, thanks for your original instructions. Re:winbind - I already had it installed, so I can't test it. Before which above step does it need to be installed? I will update my answer with a note. -121---881867- @TimothyWong Re wine 4.15 - I do get random office crashes with Wine x86 v3.4 - especially from excel. Powerpoint also does not function well. Do you know if it's ok for me to just change the wine version for the office installation from v3.4 to v4.15? Or do I need to reinstall office? -121---881868- Re: winbind, as long as it is installed before you start the Setup32.exe. It will crash if not installed, but if you install it after it will still work. Re: wine 4.15, if i recall correctly, I tried that once, but it ended up crashing all applications (it won't even start). A clean install is definitely the way to do this. -121---881869- +1 for good workarounds to avoid ImageMagick's security restrictions :-) -121---882105- Good point. Updating comment as this only applies to new installs. -121---882254- didnt work for me. ~/.cache/update-manager-core/meta-release didn't exist -121---881968- This will prevent suspend-to-disk and resume. (Can also be done by uninstalling ...resume... probably.) But thanks for the hint, I disabled resume from command prompt, and could boot once to fix my problems. -121---882174- Does this mean [1181] is the same as it being omitted? The verbose part makes sense. -121---882146- Note that, if one is to do this, one should still quote the pattern so that the shell does not expand it. Otherwise, strange and undesired results will ensue if any file in the current directory is (in the example given here) named starting with [1182]. In place of [1183], any of [1184], [1185], or [1186] will prevent the shell from doing its own expansion (and the shell performs quote removal before passing the argument to [1187], so [1188] will itself see [1189]). -121---881909- @EliahKagan thanks. -121---881910- @WinEunuuchs2Unix yes, exactly! Edited my answer to make that more clear. Also, added a warning from the man page. -121---882147- how do i make it the default file manager? -121---881903- @AlbertoSalviaNovella Any more details on how to use this tool? Or do i just have to install it and I'm done? -121---882103- I guess @Drew is running Ubuntu on his Macbook Pro... [1190] doesn't seem to work on those machines. -121---882250- This is probably the best solution on here seeing as Canonical is trying to force the use of snapd after originally stating that it would never replace apt. -121---882016- @guiverc: I have no idea what's going on under the hood, but I can upload files successfully from my drive mounted at [1191], which was not discoverable before. -121---882023-
