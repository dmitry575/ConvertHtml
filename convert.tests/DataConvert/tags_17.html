<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>The fastest and easiest way to get started is to run MongoDB and Parse Server locally:</p>

<p><code>
$ npm install -g parse-server mongodb-runner
$ mongodb-runner start
$ parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY
</code></p>

<p>You can use any arbitrary string as your application id and master key. These will be used by your clients to authenticate with the Parse Server.</p>

<p>That's it! You are now running a standalone version of Parse Server on your machine.</p>
